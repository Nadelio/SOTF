## Reporting a Vulnerability

Okay so I am not very good at Cybersecurity, this code does not relay any information back to me or to other contributors, it does not relay information outside of your computer at all. This game, once you download it, is completely local.

IF for some reason, it does cause a vulnerability of some sort, please, PLEASE, put it in the issues tab so I can lock downloads of this repo until the issue is fixed. I will try my best to fix the vulnerability.
