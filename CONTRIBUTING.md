Hey okay, so if you want to contribute join the discord I have added in the README.md, if you plan on using my code (although I do not recommend doing that because it isn't great), please credit me and have the link to this repo somewhere in your code. I encourage any ideas or improvements you may have for my code, so please, feel free to send a message on the discord server or in the issues tab here. Thanks :)
