# To Contributors
Hey okay, so if you want to contribute join the discord I have added in the README.md, if you plan on using my code (although I do not recommend doing that because it isn't great), please credit me and have the link to this repo somewhere in your code. I encourage any ideas or improvements you may have for my code, so please, feel free to send a message on the discord server or in the issues tab here. Thanks :)
#
If you want access to this repo, I can build a branch for you so that you can push changes to the branch, but be unable to change the main code files until I approve of the changes (and have tested the changes)
#
Currently I want to improve the cycling system (the choose_poi() function) to prevent crashes and make it more streamlined, also any other minor improvements to code performance is welcome.
Afterwards, I'd like to work towards the trait and research tree systems
I have a full planned feature roadmap in the discord server linked in the README.md file, please look at that for further information.

__Please make sure that you name your commits after your username__


EX: commit message -> ``Nadelio``


This will help me figure out who did what and when without digging through the code.
